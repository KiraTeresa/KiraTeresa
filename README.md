ðŸ‘‹ Hi, this is @KiraTeresa
<br>
I am new to programming and coding and all that stuff, but I am very eager to learn and to become better every day.
My goal is to change careers and make coding my everyday job. Therefore, I am going to do a Web Development Bootcamp in order to learn everything from scratch.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
<br>...HTML, CSS, JavaScript and nodeJS
