ðŸ‘‹ Hi, this is Kira
<br>
My coding journey started with the Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack in May 2022. During the following six months I learned all the skills needed, in order to become a Fullstack Developer.
I was soon offered a trainee position as a software developer. After continuously deepening my knowledge, learning new skills and developing myself every day, I was able to leave the trainee position early.
Since then I am working as a Software Developer, keep growing and stay curious.

ðŸ’» My stack:
<br>React, Next.js, Redux, Angular, RxJS, nodeJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Jest, Cypress, mongoDB, expressJS, mongoose, HTML, CSS

ðŸŒ± Currently learning:
<br>diving into Go
<br>continuously deepening my React and Next.js skills
