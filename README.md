ðŸ‘‹ Hi, this is @KiraTeresa
<br>
I am new to programming and coding and all that stuff, but I am very eager to learn and to become better every day.
My goal is to change careers and make coding my everyday job. Therefore, I am going to do a Web Development Bootcamp in order to learn everything from scratch.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...
<br>Next to coding I really like to read, play the guitar or do some kind of sport e.g. climbing, yoga or snowboarding (just to name a few).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
<br>...HTML, CSS and JavaScript
